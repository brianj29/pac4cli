pac4cli for Debian
-----------------

We install the python packages txdbus and systemd at post-install time through
pip. The former since it hasn't been packaged yet; the latter because we need a
later version.

The package txdbus it's also not strictly python3 compatible expect by a little
workaround.  If a future version properly supports python3 and if it gets a
debian package, I'll depend on that, instead.

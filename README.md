## Proxy-auto-discovery for command line applications (pac4cli)

On many corporate networks, applications need
[proxy-auto-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Auto-Discovery_Protocol)
to know whether a certain URL is accessed either directly or through a web
proxy. Browsers can typically handle this, but many command line applications
(git, npm, apt, curl) rely on environment variable to hard-code a proxy
regardless of the destination URL.

This little daemon enables these applications for auto-discovery by:

- setting the `http_proxy` variable (and friends) to http://localhost:3128
- providing a simple proxy at that port that does proxy-auto-discovery and
  connects accordingly.

System dependencies:
- systemd
- NetworkManager

In addition, a few Python package dependencies are installed through pip.
